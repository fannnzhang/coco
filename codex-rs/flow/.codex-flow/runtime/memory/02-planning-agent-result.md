Plan generated per ProjectPlanner_v2.0 spec and saved under `.codex-flow/artifacts/plan/` with anchors + manifest:

- `01_Plan_Overview_and_Setup.md` (Sections 1–4, Medium scale classification, architecture & directory tree).
- `02_Iteration_I1.md` … `02_Iteration_I4.md` (Section 5 details for each iteration, 20 fully-scoped tasks with inputs/targets/deliverables/dependencies).
- `03_Verification_and_Glossary.md` (Sections 6–7 covering verification strategy and glossary).
- `plan_manifest.json` (maps every anchor to its file for downstream agent retrieval).

Let me know if you’d like adjustments (e.g., different iteration count, artifact formats, or additional tasks) before execution begins.
