# Git Commit Workflow

You are drafting a concise commit message for the current repository.

1. Read the staged diff from the user input.
2. Produce a short subject line (<50 chars) plus, if needed, a wrapped body.
3. Follow Conventional Commit style when obvious; otherwise describe the change plainly.
